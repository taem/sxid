sxid (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debianization.
  * Changed version from 'v3.x.x' format to '3.x.x'
  * Now officially called just sXid (not sXid Secure). IMO, nothing is
    truly secure and I don't want to mislead any one :)
  * Added include for sys/types.h in structs.h for libc5 systems which
    didn't define uid_t or gid_t in pwd.h/grp.h
  * Moved all version references to configure for easier maintainence
  * Changed some make stuff to work with debian build
  * Updated copyrights for correct FSF address
  * Modifed error/warning messages
  * Did not exit on some errors (namely failure to get md5sum, and opening
    log file), but continue with output
  * Modified add_file_entry() to accept the entire stat struct as a param
    instead of each seperate field
  * Fixed problem where file inode changes (but not md5) were being
    reported but not showing what changed (files will now report md5
    changes and/or inode changes in output)
  * Added #ifdef's to headers
  * Added spotcheck functionality

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Mar 1999 14:48:18 -0500

sxid (3.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added include for limits.h to fix PATH_MAX in Solaris
  * Replaced snprintf()'s with sprintf()'s since most were not neccesary
    (known length) and the rest contained paths and could be safely guessed
    using PATH_MAX (fixes compiles on some systems)
  * Added #define for uint (needs to be in configure...)
  * Removed typedef on conf_opt struct
  * Added default define for uint
  * Added default define for PATH_MAX if not defined
  * Moved pwd.h and grp.h includes to structs.h
  * Added include for string.h to stop compile warnings on some setup's
  * Added (int) cast for mode_t which caused some compile warnings
  * Fixed malloc's for octal mode_t so they didn't assume, but calculated
    the size needed.
  * Fixed some other malloc's using a more system independent calculation
  * Fixed problem for digest and digest_hex in search_path() (Thanks to
    Peter Sulecki <psulecki@ios.krakow.pl> for finding this one)
  * Removed alot of malloc()'s in logging.c and reworked alot of the report
    functions to be a little more efficient.
  * Added checks for failed malloc()'s
  * Fixed config options init to really recognize when a config option was
    not present in the config file

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Feb 1999 00:00:00 -0500

    file
  * Made sxid.1's reference to /etc/sxid.conf depend on output from
    configure
  * Completed man pages for sxid and sxid.conf, also updated README
  * Put define for CONF_FILE into config.h as opposed to Makefile

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Feb 1999 00:00:00 -0500

sxid (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

    functions
  * Made use of sxid.conf file for dynamic settings

  * Inluded 2 sub's that were in my perl libs but not everyone elses :)

sxid (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted to a perl script to allow more features
  * Added md5 checksum eval for files. Enables better tracking of file
    changes. Directories are still checked via inode.
  * Added checking for change in uid and gid of items
  * Added checking of mode changes in files (regardless of if the +s
    bits are the same). Helps to make sure the files you may have set for
    special access remain that way.
  * Added ability to designate certain directories as anti +s meaning  
    that there should be no +s files in them (/home for example). Also
    has the ability to -s those files if desired.
  * Removed a few uneeded tmp files, now only creates two
  * More readable output on emails
  * Removed ANSI_TEXT since no mail clients (that I know of) support ansi
  * Added checks for uid's and gid's that don't have a passwd or group
    entry (ie. no matching name for the number)

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Oct 1998 00:00:00 -0500
   
sxid (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched to using a bash shell to incorporate $RANDOM (some
    standard sh's don't have this)
  * Added test before writing tmp files to avoid clobbering links, so
    a world writable tmp (such as /tmp) can be used with out worry
  * Added alot of comments for each section of code ;)

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Jul 1998 00:00:00 -0500
   
sxid (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release
