sxid (4.20130802-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Now sXid uses SHA-256 hash function to track files.
  MD5 is considered cryptographically broken.
  Please see http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068.

  According to the above, you need to backup and remove log files
  since they aren't compatible with this version. Then set $ENABLE
  in /etc/default/sxid to "yes" to enable cron entry.
