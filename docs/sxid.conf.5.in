.TH SXID.CONF 5 "January 2002" "sXid @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
.I sxid.conf
\- configuration settings for
.I sxid
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the configuration file used by sxid to define it's parameters for
execution. By default it is
.I @TMPCONF@/sxid.conf
but can be anything using the --config command line option for
.I sxid.
Options in this file are in the form of
.I OPTION
=
.I """VALUE""".
Note that the
.I VALUE
must be contained in double quotes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBALWAYS_NOTIFY\fR
If
.I sxid
does not find any changes it will not send an email unless you specify "yes"
here.
.TP
\fBALWAYS_ROTATE\fR
Usually
.I sxid
will only rotate the log files when there is a change from the last run. This
is usually best, since all logs will record a change rather than just a run of
the program. If you want to rotate the logs every time
.I sxid
is run, regardless of changes, specify "yes" here.
.TP
\fBEMAIL\fR
Where to send the email containing the output of changes every time
.I sxid
is run. Example:

EMAIL = "Great Admin <root@host.com>"
.TP
\fBENFORCE\fR
Normally
.I sxid
only flags items which are suid or sgid and are in a
.I FORBIDDEN
directory. With this option set to "yes"
.I sxid
will remove the s[ug]id bit(s) on any files or directories it finds in forbidden
directories and report any changes in the email. Note that directories listed
in
.I FORBIDDEN
are searched regardless of whether or not they are listed in
.I SEARCH.
However,
.I EXCLUDED
options still apply to directories that fall under them.
.TP
\fBEXCLUDE\fR
A space seperated list of directories to exclude from the search. Note that
if a
.I SEARCH
path falls under an
.I EXCLUDE
path that it will still be searched. This is useful for excluding whole directories
and only specifying one. Example:

SEARCH  = "/usr /usr/src/linux"

EXCLUDE = "/usr/src"
.TP
\fBEXTRA_LIST\fR
File that contains a list of (each on it's own line)  of other files that
sxid should monitor. This is useful for files that aren't +s, but relate
to system integrity (tcpd, inetd, apache...). Example: 

EXTRA_LIST = "/etc/sxid.list"
.TP
\fBFORBIDDEN\fR
A space seperated list of directories that are not supposed to contain any
suid or sgid items. Items which are suid or sgid in these directories are
flagged in the email seperately from the other listings whether there are
other changes or not. Example:

FORBIDDEN = "/tmp /home"
.TP
\fBIGNORE_DIRS\fR
Ignore entries for directories in these paths. This means that only files
will be recorded. You can effectively ignore all directory entries by 
setting this to "/".
.TP
\fBKEEP_LOGS\fR
This is a numerical value for how many log files to keep when rotating.
.TP
\fBLISTALL\fR
Forces a list of all entries to be included in th output. Implies
.I ALWAYS_NOTIFY.
.TP
\fBLOG_FILE\fR
The full path of where to store the log files. These will be rotated, each
rotated log being suffixed with a digit. The directories must already exist.
This is usually /var/log/sxid.log. Rotated logs would look like /var/log/sxid.log.n
where 'n' is the number in the rotation. The current log has no suffix.
.TP
\fBMAIL_PROG\fR
Mail program. This changes the default compiled in mailer for reports. You
only need this if you have changed it's location and don't want to
recompile sxid.
.TP
\fBSEARCH\fR
A space seperated list of directories to search. Sxid will use these
as a starting point for it's searches. Example:

SEARCH = "/usr /bin /lib"
