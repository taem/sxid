.Sh NAME
.Nm sxid.conf
.Nd configuration settings for sXid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
This is the configuration file used by
.Nm sXid
to define it's parameters for execution. By default it is
.Pa @TMPCONF@/sxid.conf
but can be anything using the
.Fl -config
command line option for
.Nm sXid .
.Pp
Options in this file are in the form of
.Bd -literal
OPTION = "VALUE"
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the
.Ar VALUE
must be contained in double quotes.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va ALWAYS_NOTIFY
If
.Nm sXid
does not find any changes it will not send an email unless
you specify
.Qq yes
here.
.It Va ALWAYS_ROTATE
Usually
.Nm sXid
will only rotate the log files when there is a change from the last run. This
is usually best, since all logs will record a change rather than just a run of
the program. If you want to rotate the logs every time
.Nm sXid
is run, regardless of changes, specify
.Qq yes
here.
.It Va EMAIL
Where to send the email containing the output of changes every time
.Nm sXid
is run. Example:
.Bd -literal
EMAIL = "System Administrator <sysadmin@example.com>"
.Ed
.It Va ENFORCE
Normally
.Nm sXid
only flags items which are suid or sgid and are in a
.Va FORBIDDEN
directory. With this option set to
.Qq yes
.Nm sXid
will remove the s[ug]id bit(s) on any files or directories it finds in forbidden
directories and report any changes in the email. Note that directories listed
in
.Va FORBIDDEN
are searched regardless of whether or not they are listed in
.Va SEARCH .
However,
.Va EXCLUDE
option still apply to directories that fall under them.
.It Va EXCLUDE
A space separated list of directories to exclude from the search. Note that
if a
.Va SEARCH
path falls under an
.Va EXCLUDE
path that it will still be searched. This is useful for excluding whole
directories and only specifying one. Example:
.Bd -literal
SEARCH  = "/usr /usr/src/linux"
EXCLUDE = "/usr/src"
.Ed
.It Va EXTRA_LIST
File that contains a list of (each on it's own line)  of other files that
.Nm sXid
should monitor. This is useful for files that aren't +s, but relate
to system integrity (tcpd, inetd, apache...). Example:
.Bd -literal
EXTRA_LIST = "/etc/sxid.list"
.Ed
.It Va FORBIDDEN
A space separated list of directories that are not supposed to contain any
suid or sgid items. Items which are suid or sgid in these directories are
flagged in the email separately from the other listings whether there are
other changes or not. Example:
.Bd -literal
FORBIDDEN = "/tmp /home"
.Ed
.It Va IGNORE_DIRS
Ignore entries for directories in these paths. This means that only files
will be recorded. You can effectively ignore all directory entries by
setting this to
.Qq / .
.It Va KEEP_LOGS
This is a numerical value for how many log files to keep when rotating.
.It Va LISTALL
Forces a list of all entries to be included in the output. Implies
.Va ALWAYS_NOTIFY .
.It Va LOG_FILE
The full path of where to store the log files. These will be rotated, each
rotated log being suffixed with a digit. The directories must already exist.
This is usually
.Pa /var/log/sxid.log .
Rotated logs would look like
.Pa /var/log/sxid.log.n
where
.Dq n
is the number in the rotation. The current log has no suffix.
.It Va MAIL_PROG
Mail program. This changes the default compiled in mailer for reports. You
only need this if you have changed it's location and don't want to
recompile
.Nm sXid.
.It Va SEARCH
A space separated list of directories to search.
.Nm sXid
will use these as a starting point for it's searches. Example:
.Bd -literal
SEARCH = "/usr /bin /lib"
