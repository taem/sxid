.TH SXID.CONF 5 2013-05-21 "sXid @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
.B sxid.conf
\- configuration settings for sXid
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the configuration file used by \fBsXid\fP to define it's parameters for
execution. By default it is \fI@TMPCONF@/sxid.conf\fP
but can be anything using the \fB\-\-config\fP command line option for
\fBsXid\fP.
Options in this file are in the form of \fBOPTION\fP = "\fIVALUE\fP".
Note that the \fIVALUE\fP must be contained in double quotes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBALWAYS_NOTIFY\fP
If \fBsXid\fP does not find any changes it will not send an email unless
you specify \*(lqyes\*(rq here.
.TP
\fBALWAYS_ROTATE\fP
Usually \fBsXid\fP
will only rotate the log files when there is a change from the last run. This
is usually best, since all logs will record a change rather than just a run of
the program. If you want to rotate the logs every time \fBsXid\fP
is run, regardless of changes, specify \*(lqyes\*(rq here.
.TP
\fBEMAIL\fP
Where to send the email containing the output of changes every time \fBsXid\fP
is run. Example:

EMAIL = "System Administrator <sysadmin@example.com>"
.TP
\fBENFORCE\fP
Normally \fBsXid\fP only flags items which are suid or sgid and are in a
\fBFORBIDDEN\fP directory. With this option set to \*(lqyes\*(rq \fBsXid\fP
will remove the s[ug]id bit(s) on any files or directories it finds in forbidden
directories and report any changes in the email. Note that directories listed
in \fBFORBIDDEN\fP are searched regardless of whether or not they are listed in
\fBSEARCH\fP. However, \fBEXCLUDED\fP
options still apply to directories that fall under them.
.TP
\fBEXCLUDE\fP
A space separated list of directories to exclude from the search. Note that
if a \fBSEARCH\fP path falls under an \fBEXCLUDE\fP
path that it will still be searched. This is useful for excluding whole
directories and only specifying one. Example:

SEARCH  = "/usr /usr/src/linux"

EXCLUDE = "/usr/src"
.TP
\fBEXTRA_LIST\fP
File that contains a list of (each on it's own line)  of other files that
sxid should monitor. This is useful for files that aren't +s, but relate
to system integrity (tcpd, inetd, apache...). Example: 

EXTRA_LIST = "/etc/sxid.list"
.TP
\fBFORBIDDEN\fP
A space separated list of directories that are not supposed to contain any
suid or sgid items. Items which are suid or sgid in these directories are
flagged in the email separately from the other listings whether there are
other changes or not. Example:

FORBIDDEN = "/tmp /home"
.TP
\fBIGNORE_DIRS\fP
Ignore entries for directories in these paths. This means that only files
will be recorded. You can effectively ignore all directory entries by 
setting this to \*(lq/\*(rq.
.TP
\fBKEEP_LOGS\fP
This is a numerical value for how many log files to keep when rotating.
.TP
\fBLISTALL\fP
Forces a list of all entries to be included in th output. Implies
\fBALWAYS_NOTIFY\fP.
.TP
\fBLOG_FILE\fP
The full path of where to store the log files. These will be rotated, each
rotated log being suffixed with a digit. The directories must already exist.
This is usually \fI/var/log/sxid.log\fP. Rotated logs would look like
\fI/var/log/sxid.log.n\fP where \*(lqn\*(rq is the number in the rotation.
The current log has no suffix.
.TP
\fBMAIL_PROG\fP
Mail program. This changes the default compiled in mailer for reports. You
only need this if you have changed it's location and don't want to
recompile sxid.
.TP
\fBSEARCH\fP
A space separated list of directories to search. Sxid will use these
as a starting point for it's searches. Example:

SEARCH = "/usr /bin /lib"
