.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sXid
checks for changes in suid and sgid files and directories based on its last
check. Logs are stored by default in
.Pa /var/log/sxid.log .
The changes are then emailed to the address specified in the configuration
file. The default location for the config file is
.Pa @TMPCONF@/sxid.conf
but this can be overridden with the
.Fl -config
option and specifying an
alternate
.Ar file .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c, -config Ar file
Specifies an alternate configuration
.Ar file .
.It Fl n, -nomail
Sends output to stdout instead of emailing, useful for spot checks.
.It Fl k, -spotcheck
Checks for changes by recursing the current working directory. Log files
will not be rotated and no email sent. All output will go to stdout.
.It Fl l, -listall
Useful when doing
.Fl -spotcheck
or
.Fl -nomail
to list all files that are logged, regardless of changes.
.It Fl h, -help
Display a brief help message.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT
.Pp
The program outputs several different checks concerning the current status of
the suid and sgid files and directories on the system on which it was
run. This is a basic overview of the format.
.Pp
In the add remove section, new files are preceded by a
.Dq + ,
old ones
are preceded by a
.Dq - .
Note that removed does not mean gone from the filesystem, just that it
is no longer sgid or suid.
.Pp
Most of it is pretty easy to understand. On the sections that show
changes in the file's info (uid, gid, modes...) the format is
old->new. So if the old owner was
.Dq mail
and it is now
.Dq root
then it shows it as mail->root.
.Pp
The list of files in the checks is in the following format:
.Bd -literal
/full/path   *user.group   MODE
.Ed
.Pp
MODE is the 4 digit mode, as in 4755.
.Pp
In the changes section, if the line is preceded by an
.Dq i
then that item has changed inodes since the last check (regardless of any
s[ug]id change), if there is an
.Dq m
then the md5sum has changed.
.Pp
If a user or group entry is preceded by a
.Dq *
then it's execution bit is set (ie. *root.wheel is suid, root.*wheel
is sgid, *root.*wheel is +s).
.Pp
On the forbidden directories, if
.Va ENFORCE
is enabled an
.Dq r
will precede forbidden items that were successfully \-s'd, and an
.Do
!
.Dc
will show that it was unsuccesfully \-s'd (for what ever reason).
